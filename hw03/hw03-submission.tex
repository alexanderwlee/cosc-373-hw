  \begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
    \item We proceed with devising a greedy algorithm that is guaranteed to
      produce a proper $\Delta + 1$ coloring of $G$. The algorithm executes as
      follows:
      \begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)}]
        \item Initialize an empty set $C$, which represents the set of colors.
        \item Assign any vertex in $V$ the color 1 and add 1 to $C$.
        \item Choose an uncolored vertex $v \in V$. Assign $v$ the smallest
          color in $C$ that has not been assigned to $v$'s colored neighbors. If
          $v$'s colored neighbors have been assigned all the colors in $C$, add
          a new color $\max\{C\} + 1$ to $C$ and assign it to $v$.
        \item Repeat step (2) until all vertices are colored.
      \end{enumerate}

      Since the algorithm assigns an uncolored vertex $v \in V$ with the lowest
      color in $C$ that has not been assigned to $v$'s neighbors or assigns $v$
      with a new color not yet in $C$, no two neighboring vertices are assigned
      the same color. Furthermore, because the algorithm only adds a new color
      to $C$ when all neighbors of $v$ have been assigned all the colors in $C$
      and $v$ has at most $\Delta$ neighbors, the algorithm adds at most $\Delta
      + 1$ colors to $C$. Thus, only $\Delta + 1$ colors are required.
      Therefore, the algorithm produces a proper $\Delta + 1$ coloring of $G$.

    \item Consider the graph $G_k$ of $\Delta + 1$ vertices, where each vertex
      is connected to every other vertex. In this case, every vertex has a
      degree of $\Delta$, so the maximum degree is $\Delta$. Now, suppose
      towards a contradiction that we have a $\Delta$ proper coloring of $G_k$.
      Thus, at most $\Delta$ colors have been assigned to $\Delta + 1$ vertices
      of $G_k$. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two vertices in $G_k$ have
      been assigned the same color. Since every vertex is connected to every
      other vertex, these two vertices with the same color are neighbors. This
      is a contradiction since we assumed that we have a $\Delta$ proper
      coloring of $G_k$, where no two neighboring vertices are assigned the same
      color. Therefore, $G_k$ does not admit a proper $\Delta$ coloring.

    \item Each phase $i$:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Execute protocol $\Pi$
        \item If node is in the MIS found from $\Pi$
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Output $i$ and halt
          \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}

      (Correctness) In each phase $i$, protocol $\Pi$ finds a MIS in the network
      of remaining nodes that have not halted. The nodes found in the MIS from
      phase $i$ output color $i$. Neighboring nodes will not output the same
      color since they belong to different maximal independent sets.

      (Runtime) After each phase if a node is not in a MIS, then at least one of
      its neighbors becomes part of an MIS, by the maximality condition.
      As such, after each phase, a node's degree decreases by at least one.
      Since a node has at most $\Delta$ neighbors, at most $\Delta$ phases are
      needed so that all it's neighbors are assigned a color. Hence, each node
      requires at most $\Delta + 1$ phases to output a color $i$. Since each
      phase runs in $T(n)$ rounds, the protocol thus computes a property $\Delta
      + 1$ coloring of $G$ in $O((\Delta + 1) T(n)) = O(\Delta T(n) + T(n)) =
      O(\Delta T(n))$ rounds.

      (Congestion) Since the above protocol uses the CONGEST protocol $\Pi$ and
      apart from in protocol $\Pi$, nodes do not send messages to each other,
      the protocol above is a CONGEST protocol.
